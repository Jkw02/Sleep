This repository contains code and resources for conducting sleep analysis using the Kaggle Sleep Dataset. The dataset comprises various sleep-related measurements collected from individuals over a period of time. The analysis in this project aims to explore sleep patterns, identify trends, and derive insights related to sleep quality and duration. Moreover, a conclusion is made about what factor affects sleep the most.

The dataset used in this project can be found on Kaggle and accessed via KaggleAPI:(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uom190346a/sleep-health-and-lifestyle-dataset). The dataset includes features such as sleep duration, sleep stages, heart rate, stress level and other measurable factors.

The Jupyter file titled Group Project Visualization contains most analysis and graphs obtained. All insights are stated. A clean data set was also used with the code from the file titled "Loading Data". This ensured through analysis could be made as well as valid insights.

 It's recommended to use a virtual environment. Python, Jupyter notebooks as well as the sleep dataset from kaggle should also be used. Pandas and matplotlib are also used during analysis.
